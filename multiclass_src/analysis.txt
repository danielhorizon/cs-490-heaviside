CIFAR-10
2048 Imbalanced
- Approx beats Baseline (CE) at almost all evaluation thresholds. 
- Across the classes, Mean-F1 is the highest for class #9, and lowest for class #4. 
- It is apparent that Eval Threshold = 0.1 has higher mean-F1 scores than tau = 0.2 or tau = 0.3 
We see the similar class performance with the baseline CE, which makes sense (because trained on same seeds). 


1024 Imbalanced 
- Generally, the lower the eval tau, the more classes where Approx-F1 beats CE. 
- On class #4, we see the same issue where the class performs poorly for both Approx-F1 and CE. 
- The higher the eval tau (for the imbalanced class), the better the approx-f1 scores compared to CE.
